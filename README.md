# Dementia-Inequalities-PNAS
********************
*** INTRODUCTION ***
********************

This data repository includes all Stata and MATLAB program files used in the project "Trends in Inequalities in the Prevalence of Dementia in the U.S." by Péter Hudomiet, Michael D. Hurd, and Susann Rohwedder. The paper is currently (10/3/2022) conditionally accepted in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). 
The project’s objective and the details of the statistical methods are discussed in the published article and its supplementary appendix.
With questions, please get in touch with the corresponding author: Péter Hudomiet (Peter_Hudomiet@rand.org)
The data repository includes four zip files, each containing a set of program codes:
1) DataCleaning.zip: Five Stata do files that clean and preprocess all the data used in the project. (Details below)
2) MCMC-Model.zip: Four MATLAB program files that estimate the cognitive status of each person in each survey wave.
3) PostEstimation.zip: Seven Stata do files that create all the tables and figures presented in the main paper.
4) SupplementaryFiles.zip: Two MATLAB programs and eight Stata do files that create all the tables and figures in the supplementary appendix.

*** DATA NEEDED ***
*******************

The project used data from the core Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and its supplements available at https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products. Most of the datafiles are publicly available upon registration on the HRS website. The ADAMS supplement is sensitive data. To access ADAMS, please follow the application procedure explained on the HRS website. 
To run the programs, one needs to get access to the following data files:
1) The HRS Tracker file: it includes basic identifiers and status variables. We used the 2016 tracker file (TRK2106TR_R.dta), but this can be replaced with a newer tracker file.
2) The RAND-HRS Longitudinal File: it includes cleaned versions of the most important HRS variables. We used version 1 of the 2016 file (randhrs1992_2016v1.dta), but this could be replaced with newer data versions.
3) The RAND-HRS Detailed Imputation File: It includes additional imputed variables that are not part of the main RAND-HRS file. We used version 1 of the 2016 file (randhrsimp1992_2016v1.dta), but this could be replaced with newer data versions.
4) The 2000-2016 RAND-HRS Fat Files that include all the uncleaned raw HRS data.
5) The Health and Retirement Study Imputation of Cognitive Functioning Measures: it includes imputed cognition measures. These measures are normally added to the RAND-HRS datafile, but the randhrs1992_2016v1.dta did not yet have the 2016 wave of these measures. If newer RAND-HRS releases are used, this data file may not be needed.
6)  The Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). This is a supplemental study in the HRS that conducted in-person clinical assessments of cognitive status and dementia. The ADAMS supplement is sensitive data and requires an application, as explained on the HRS website..

*** THE PROGRAM FILES ***
************************
*DataCleaning.zip includes five Stata do files:
1) Step0_Master.do: A master do file that calls the other files.
2) Step1_BasicVars.do: Merges the relevant data files and applies basic data cleaning.
3) Step2_Cognition.do: Cleans the detailed cognition measures that are not part of the RAND-HRS Longitudinal file.
4) Step3_Adams.do: Cleans the ADAMS data.
5) Step4_FinalClean.do: Final cleaning of the data, including consistency checks, logical imputations, other initial imputations (missing data are imputed using multiple imputation in the MCMC model), labeling the variables, and saving the datafiles in Stata and txt. 

*MCMC-Model.zip includes four MATLAB program files:
1) Master_HRSdata_Release1.m: A master file that calls the other files and saves the data.
2) DataLoad_Release1.m: Loads the txt data files and stores them in MATLAB format.
3) MCMC_Estimate_Release1.m: Estimates the MCMC model. This is the main estimation file.
4) GaussHermite.m: An auxiliary file created by Geert Van Damme to determine the abscisas and weights for the Gauss-Hermite quadrature used for numerical integration. 

*PostEstimation.zip includes seven Stata do files:
1) Step1_MCMC-Load.do: Loads the data created by the MCMC model and saves Stata versions.
2) Step2_SimData.do: Loads the 901 simulated cognition values and saves them in 901 separate Stata files. These datasets are used to estimate corrected standard errors that take into account the uncertainties from the MCMC model.
3) The rest of the files create the two figures and tables of the main paper. The file names correspond to the tables and figures.

*SupplementaryFiles.zip: Ten files that create most of the tables and figures in the supplementary appendix. The MCMC model creates the rest.
1) Master_SyntheticData_Release1.m: A master file used to estimate the MCMC model on synthetic data with known parameter values.
2) DataCreate_Release1.m: Creates a synthetic data file with known parameter values.
3) The rest of the Stata do files create the supplementary tables and figures. The file names correspond to the tables and figures.
